# FinancialSage
**An intelligent pipeline for financial document processing, semantic search, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics, designed to handle structured, unstructured, and scanned records with minimal human intervention.**

---

## Introduction
FinancialSage is a modular and automated system for processing financial documents of various formats, including invoices, receipts, contracts, statements, and scanned handwritten notes.  
It integrates modern AI components: neural embeddings, semantic search, optical character recognition (OCR), question answering (QA), and predictive analytics to improve efficiency, enhance accuracy, and provide actionable insights for finance teams, auditors, and analysts.

---

## Core Features
- OCR support for scanned and handwritten documents via **Google Cloud Vision API**.  
- Semantic search using **Sentence-Transformers embeddings** and **FAISS** for efficient similarity search.  
- **NLP Question Answering**:  
  - **Extractive QA** with `deepset/roberta-base-squad2`.  
  - **Generative QA** using the **Google Gemini API**.  
- **Anomaly Detection** with **Isolation Forest** for financial transactions.  
- **Forecasting and Time-Series Analysis** with **ARIMA** and **Seasonal Decomposition**.  
- **Data extraction and cleaning** with regex and text normalization for amounts, dates, and entities.  
- Real-time insights, analytics, and visualization of financial metrics.  
- Extensible architecture for integrating structured and unstructured financial data.

## System Workflow
- **File Ingestion** – Uploads PDFs, Excel, and text-based financial documents.  
- **OCR Processing** – For scanned PDFs, `pdf2image` converts pages to images, then **Google Vision OCR** extracts text.  
- **Text Cleaning & Normalization** – Regex fixes, tokenization, and number parsing.  
- **Embeddings Generation** – Sentences converted into contextual vectors using **Sentence-BERT (MiniLM)**.  
- **Vector Indexing** – Embeddings stored in a **FAISS index** for efficient semantic search.  
- **Query System**:  
  - Candidate retrieval via FAISS similarity search.  
  - Extractive QA via RoBERTa-SQuAD2.  
  - Generative QA via Gemini API.  
- **Predictive Analytics** – Anomaly detection with Isolation Forest, forecasting with ARIMA, and seasonal decomposition.  
- **Visualization & Monitoring** – Financial trends and anomalies visualized with matplotlib/seaborn.

## Key Results
- Automated extraction and understanding of financial documents (scanned and digital).  
- Rich semantic search with contextual embeddings instead of keyword matching.  
- Accurate anomaly detection for outlier financial records.  
- Forecasting of financial trends using ARIMA and decomposition.  
- Advanced Q&A system for both extractive and generative responses.
